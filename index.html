    <h1>Max Headroom Signal Hijackings</h1>
    <p>The Max Headroom Hijackings occured on November 22nd, 1987 in Chicago, Illinois. To this day, nobody knows who the culprit was that took over the a local TV station.
        There were two separate incidents of the news channel being taken over about 2 hours apart.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2> Who is Max Headroom?</h2>
    <p>The man in the hijackings most notable feature is the mask he's wearing of Max Headroom, but who is that? Well, Max Headroom is a fictional character that was created in
    1985 as the first "computer generated TV personality", although in reality it was just a man wearing a costume and heavy prosthetics to give an uncanny valley appearance.
    In his show titled <i>The Max Headroom Show</i>, it would normally start with Max appearing to hijack the broadcast to show music videos. While the character had a brief 
    reappearance in 2007 and a cameo in <i>Pixels</i>, he has widely been forgotten since then. It's arguable that more people remember Max Headroom for the signal hijackings
    rather than the character itself.</p>
