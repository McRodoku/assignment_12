    <h1>Max Headroom Signal Hijackings</h1>
    <p>The Max Headroom Hijackings occured on November 22nd, 1987 in Chicago, Illinois. To this day, nobody knows who the culprit was that took over 2 different local TV stations.
        There were two separate incidents of take overs about 2 hours apart.</p>

    <h2> Who is Max Headroom?</h2>
    <p>The man in the hijackings most notable feature is the mask he's wearing of Max Headroom, but who is that? Well, Max Headroom is a fictional character that was created in
    1985 as the first "computer generated TV personality", although in reality it was just a man wearing a costume and heavy prosthetics to give an uncanny valley appearance.
    In his show titled <i>The Max Headroom Show</i>, it would normally start with Max appearing to hijack the broadcast to show music videos. While the character had a brief 
    reappearance in 2007 and a cameo in <i>Pixels</i>, he has widely been forgotten since then. It's arguable that more people of today know Max Headroom for the signal hijackings
    rather than the character itself.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>The First Hijacking</h2>
    <p>The first hijacking took place on a news station called WGN-TV that was covering the football game against the Lions and the Bears at apporximately 9:14 pm. The hijack was pretty
    bland in comparison to the second one, as it didn't have much audio accompanying it aside from a garbled, static buzz. Viewers at the time had the channel signal go black for about 15 seconds before cutting to the man
    in the mask with a rotating corrugated steel background. The signal interuption only lasted about 20 seconds before engineers at WGN-TV for able to switch the frequency of the signal,
    which led to much confusion between viewers and staff alike, with the anchor on air admitting that he also had no idea what just happened.</p>
